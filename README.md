# The NHS Trust Research App

The NHS Trust Research app is a simple web app to help you do research on trusts in the NHS.

At its simplest, the app gives you a list of NHS trusts (currently only those in England) and for each trust a link to:

1. The trust's website
2. The trust's annual documents
3. The NHS Jobs page for the trust
4. The Wikipedia page for the trust
5. The Care Quality Commission results for the trust
6. The WhatDoTheyKnow freedom of information (FOI) requests & responses for the trust
7. A Google search page limited to results from the trust's website
